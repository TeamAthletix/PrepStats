// (Optional) Quick-start instructions for Phase 2 core MVP
// ===================
Notes and how to proceed

This box contains the core Phase 2 MVP code for stats (games, stat_entries, stat_verifications) plus minimal leaderboard, a basic stats entry UI, and the Spotlight flow scaffolding is included as part of Phase 2 core blocks to reflect earlier intent. If you want to strictly separate Phase 2 core vs Phase 2.1 monetization in one box, I can strip monetization-facing files and leave only the stats MVP.

Importantly, you’ll need to adapt import paths to your actual project structure if you’ve already laid out folders a bit differently.
